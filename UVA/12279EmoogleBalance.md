### 12279EmoogleBalance
This is very interesting problem. All the information is very funny. The most important information is given as a equation in bolt form. All you need to do is finding the difference between the non-zeros and zeros.
```math
Emoogle Balance = number of times Emoogle is supposed to give a treat
according to the book - number of times he has actually given the treat.
```
Just use if-ealse block for finding out zeros and non-zeros.
