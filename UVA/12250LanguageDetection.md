This is also very simple program. You can solve this problem only with switch-case/ if-else block. Main concern about this problem is getting input form console. You can't do with regular cin.
```C++
cin>>variable;
```
All you need to do is getline through which you can work directly with string i/o.
```C++
getline(cin,mystr);
```
Keep in mind the "Unknown" case.
That's all :)
